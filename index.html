        With technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the resulting 
        prevalent po- sition of this topic outside of academia, the demand to present 
        their work to a broad audience has increased in institutions conducting research 
        in AI. For example, students at the Centre of Artificial Intelligence (CAI) at the 
        Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) developed an AI demonstrator using a 
        Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot to recognize hand gestures and perform corresponding 
        actions. The Bachelor’s thesis at hand integrates this existing gesture recognition 
        into a modular control system based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) and visualizes 
        the main algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) and the ROS tool RViz. 
        The robot is equipped with an external ZED2 stereo camera and an Ouster OS1 light 
        detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor, improving the robot’s environmental perception 
        to localize itself and avoid collisions. Moreover, a Kalman filter fuses stereo camera 
        data and inertial measurements, com- bining relative and absolute state estimations. 
        A LiDAR-based map generated by a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) 
        algorithm corrects this sensor-fusion-based state estimation. The software modules 
        that provide this functionality to achieve the aforementioned research goals were 
        implemented in C++ and Python, employing the corresponding ROS libraries. The 
        developed position controller enables the robot to move on a path with a maximal 
        deviation of 0.2 m when walking on a 2 m straight line. During this motion, the 
        collision avoidance system reliably prevents collisions caused by the robot.
        Furthermore, the robot is already successfully used for live demonstrations at 
        public events to enhance the understanding of AI. The designed software platform 
        integrates ROS-based position control and collision avoidance and provides a modular 
        base for future projects on the utilized robotic platform. <br><br>

        The demand for sustainable solutions is increasing in various economic sectors and has 
        also found its way into the construction industry. Whereas customary structural designs 
        are optimized in terms of simplicity, progressive materials such as Carbon Prestressed 
        Concrete (CPC) provide mass reduction given equal properties in terms of static resilience 
        due to sophisticated geometrical arrangements and hence, reduce the carbon footprint of 
        constructions. However, the reduction of material also has negative effects on acoustic 
        performance which has therefore to be investigated. This is where multiphysics simulation 
        tools open up new opportunities. In this project, two- and three-dimensional CPC geometries 
        are investigated in terms of their sound transmission properties using finite element analysis 
        (FEA). Various two-dimensional section views as well as a three-dimensional CPC structure were 
        modeled and evaluated by their sound transmission properties over a frequency range from 1 Hz to 
        at least 720 Hz. The resulting sound transmission loss (STL) curve shows that the CPC structure 
        has, depending on the frequency observed, up to 57 dB lower damping properties in terms of 
        acoustic power than a regular concrete plate with equal outer dimension. The difference between 
        the two geometries is noticeably higher at frequencies lower than the first mechanical 
        eigenfrequency whereas at higher frequencies, the CPC structure performs better than at lower 
        ones. The tool developed in this study provides a reliable base for further simulations, where 
        the geometrical parameters can be optimized. From these results, the measurements of acoustic p
        erformance of building structures can be predicted without experimental testing. <br><br>
